## You can search everything you want with "security"

# Observations:
- Install the dependencies `npm init -y`
- Before, you need to install the Electron, so use this command `npm install electron`
- So, when you install Electron, go to your `package.json` and where it says 'script', add one: `"start": "electron index.js"` (Remember to put the name of the JavaScript file, in my case I put 'index' because it's easier for me, but it depends on your taste)

Now, execute this command: `npm start` and your application its on!

I think that's all for now, i'll update over time.
